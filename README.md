# g3-q-programmingchallenges

For the programming challenges we had to show that we could get a backend working and connect to it through the app (we demo this by pulling a "business card" which is just information about a user (name, major, position of interest). And then we also had to demonstrate a queueing system. 

This project demos both, it connects to a backend, pulls user information, and allows a user to join a queue, refresh their position in a queue, and remove themself from a queue (this bumps everyone else in the queue behind them up a position).
